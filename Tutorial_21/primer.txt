Jinja2 (the template language we are using for Flask)
Jinja2 has filters which are tools used to transform or manipulate
variables in Jinja templates.

They allow you to apply specific transformations to data before
rendering it in a template. Filters are applied using the pipe '|'
symbol (usually shift + the backslash button), usually followed
by the filter name.

for example: {{ "hello world" | capitalize }}

In this example you can see the jinja curly braces: {{ }},

the string we are transforming: "hello world",

and the pipe and filter: | capitalize,

this will result in "Hello world" being displayed
on the html page (the template) rather than
"hello world"

you can also chain filters:

{{ "  hello world   " | trim | upper }}
Output: 'HELLO WORLD'

The Jinja2 Built in filters we are using today:
upper
join

In Jinja template language, there are special loop variables
that give you additional functionality with for loops, and
their iterations. 'loop.index' is a special variable used within
a for loop to number the iterations of a for loop.

loop.index is only one of many loop-specific variables
available in Jinja2 that can help you create more
dynamic and flexible templates.
