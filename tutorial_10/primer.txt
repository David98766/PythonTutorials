Without a database or files, etc, your data is lost when your program stops running
CSV files can be used to store data beyond the life of a single program.

csv file = Comma-Seperated-Values file
AKA values are seperated by commas.

Imagine an Excel file, but instead of having the values seperated by cells, you have
the values seperated by commas.

Just like in Excel, in a CSV file there are effectively rows and columns.
each line is a row
columns are defined by commas, so the value before the first comma on each row, make up the first column.
The top of each column is called the 'header'

A Python dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs,
where each key is unique and maps to a specific value, allowing for fast data retrieval.

EXAMPLE: [{'name':'Alice'}]
name = KEY | Alice = Value

Today's tutorial involves a lot of commenting and uncommenting blocks of code.
To speed things up, use the ctrl+/ shortcut.
--> highlight a block of code and press ctrl+/ to comment/uncomment the entire block of code.
