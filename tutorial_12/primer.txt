Python has two libraries for dealing with dataframes: csv or Pandas. We only need to import 1.

Dataframes = data structures made up of rows and columns (similar to a database or Excel spreadsheet)
So the data.csv file we were looking at last week could be considered a dataframe.

The csv library and the Pandas library both have strengths and drawbacks: for example,
Pandas is generally viewed as more efficient for files with over 1 million lines, csv is
generally viewed as more straightforward/simple.

So which one you use depends on the type of project you are doing.

Generally speaking, Pandas is more useful to learn as it is used very often for developing AI
or Machine Learning solutions.

So today we are going to look at the Pandas library.
To install this we must run the following command in our project terminal:

'pip install pandas'

Go to the tutorials section of IS2208 on Canvas and download the data.csv file
Drag the data.csv file from your file explorer into the tutorial_12 directory on PyCharm
