Today we are going to create a semi-functional login & sign up tkinter application

We need to download software called DB Browser. This is an open source tool for managing SQLite databases.

We are downloading the win64.msi Standard (MSI) installer for Win64
Please make sure you download that exact version.
at this link: https://sqlitebrowser.org/blog/version-3-13-1-released/

Once you have the installer downloaded, double click on it in your file explorer (to run the installer)

Click next and default options the whole way through.

Now you need to copy some code down, which I will explain.

Start by creating a main.py file in your tutorial_14 file.

Once we have the code down, I will show ye what that DB Browser is for.

We will need to open the user.db in DB Browser, and from there we will need to select the user table in the
Table dropdown at the top left
